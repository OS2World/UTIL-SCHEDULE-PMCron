programming considerations
a) Don't let any dialog box exceed the width of 320 and the height of 200.
   There are some poor people with VGA adapters.
b) Please, comment code changes in english. Hints and error reports are
   accepted in german, too.
c) Don't use tabs, use an editor with a CR-LF pair for end-of-line.
