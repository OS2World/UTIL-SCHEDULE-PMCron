                              Cron, Version 1.21

It runs only with EMX 0.9a (or above?). Needed DLLs are EMX and EMXLIBCM.
The new DLLs with the fixes from EMXFIX04 of EMX 0.9b are included.

  crontab.exe   Self documenting. Simply, call "crontab". With this program
                commands are send to the daemon. crontab DOESN'T manipulate
                the Crontabs file, this is done by the daemon itself.
                Alternatively, you can use the daemon itself. The second
                page of the "settings..." notebook allows all changes.
  Crontabs      Probably, there is a little example file. You can use it. More
                and in different languages explained examples will be found

Code changes:   Don't use ANY tabulators (excepting in makefile). I don't like
                them. Use CRLF at end-of-line and don't use ^Z at end-of-file.
                You may use diff if you want.

The programs are tested, they work very well. The daemon doesn't eat much
memory even when running long times, although the statical size reaches about
512K (EMXLIBCM and EMX are hungry).
Good: The daemon awakes only one time a hour if nothing is to do. It will be
swapped out by the system.

Who is like to translate this stuff into netherlands, italian, spanish etc.?
